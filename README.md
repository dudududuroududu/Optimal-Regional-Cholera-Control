# Optimal-Regional-Cholera-Control
This project provides the numerical implementation for solving a large-scale optimal control problem governed by reaction-diffusion PDEs, specifically modeling cholera transmission.
The project uses MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics to solve a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model and demonstrates the efficacy of a regional optimal control strategy for cholera outbreaks.

üìã Key Features
Solves a 5D reaction-diffusion PDE system for cholera dynamics (S, V, I, R, P).
Implements a Forward-Backward Sweep Method (FBSM) to find the optimal control solution.
Compares the effectiveness of regional control vs. uniform control strategies.
Generates visualizations of infected populations and pathogen concentration over time.

üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

Before running the code, ensure you have the following software installed:

MATLAB (R2023a or later recommended)
COMSOL Multiphysics (6.0 or later) with the LiveLink for MATLAB module.
